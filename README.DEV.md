# Installation for Development

To install and starting developing on Maverick:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/YurtsAI/maverick.git`.
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install dependencies

3. Now, you can start the extension. From the top menu, choose `Run > Start Debugging`.

This will:

- Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code and watch for changes
- Open a new VSCode window (you should use the extension there)

_Note: When you make changes, you should refresh that window to apply changes. To refresh, open Command Palette (Command+Shift+P on MacOS, or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows), then choose "Developer: Reload window"_
